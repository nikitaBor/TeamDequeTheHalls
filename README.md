# TeamDequeTheHalls: Nikita Borisov, Joelle Lum, Samantha Ngo
## Method Choices
We chose to implement add(), offer(), element(), peek(), remove(), and poll(), size(), and isEmpty() because they are basic methods of Queues.
Each of these methods, besides size() and isEmpty(), function on the _front and _end so that our interface resembles a Queue and a Stack.
We also renamed certain methods whose names we thought were not clearly indicative of the method's function. Methods with "Carefully" return null if the Deque is empty or false if the Deque is full. We implemented these "careful" methods to provide alternatives to reaching errors.
* offer() -> addCarefully() -> false
* element() -> peek() -> NullPointerException
* peek()  -> peekCarefully() -> null
* poll() -> removeCarefully() -> null
## DLLNode
We chose a doubly-linked base architecture because removing and adding from a DLLNode is O(1). This is because when removing and adding we can change where arrows point to and not shift anything. ArrayList and array-based architecture would be O(n) because after removing and adding elements, we'd have to shift the other elements. 
## Updates
Mago sent a driver file that made us realize that we were lacking a toString method, after it was called in Mago's driver. We implemented a toString() method in order to accomplish this and the rest of the test case worked fine.
Team QueueTpi sent us a driver file, but it was not augmented for our specific methods. After brief modifications, it ran easily, but did not utilize all our methods.
